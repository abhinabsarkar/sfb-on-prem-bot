# Skype For Business On-Premise Bot

This is an upgrade of the [Skype For Business intranet chatbot](https://github.com/abhinabsarkar/intranet-chat-bot) developed using Dotnet Core v2.2 & Bot SDK V4 (previous one was developed using .Net Standard & Bot SDk V1).

[Dotnet Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about) is an open source, cross platform successor to .NET Framework. It has baked in [dependency injection (DI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. [Beginners tutorial on dependency injection](https://github.com/abhinabsarkar/dependencyinjection) is a good start for beginners to understand DI before going into Dotnet Core.
